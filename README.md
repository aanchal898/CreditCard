# CreditCard
This repository contains all the source code for Aanchal S.'s dual-based approach implementation of detection of fraudulent credit card transactions.
Approach 1 is based on random selection of samples from non-fraud cases with an oversampled selection of fraud cases.
Approach 2 applies weights on the loss functions of models based on the class imbalance.
